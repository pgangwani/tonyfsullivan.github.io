                I started my career working primarily on <span class='bg-highlight'>native apps</span> for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone but have focused on <span class='highlight'>full-stack javascript</span> for the last two years.
            </p>
            <p class='fw3 pv2'>
                On the backend it's mainly been Node.js hosted on <span class='bg-highlight'>AWS</span> for any production apps.  The frontend is where it really gets fun with projects in <span class='highlight'>Angular</span> and <span class='highlight'>React</span>, and most recently <span class='highlight'>Svelte and Sapper</span> (which powers this site).
            </p>
            <p class='fw3 pv2'>
                More of my energy is focused into <span class='bg-highlight'>open-source</span> projects these days, staying close to the community on <span class='highlight'>Gitter</span> and starting a blog that will be released shortly!
            </p>

                I build this site heavily influenced by <span class='bg-highlight'>Dinesh Pandiyan</span>'s personal site - what better way to get a solid comparison of React vs. Svelte than by recreating a real-world project! Take a look at <a href='https://github.com/flexdinesh/flexdinesh.github.io' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Dinesh's original project</a> and the Svelte equivalent <a href='https://github.com/tonyfsullivan/tonyfsullivan.github.io' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a> and let me know what you think of the Svelte-ified code!
